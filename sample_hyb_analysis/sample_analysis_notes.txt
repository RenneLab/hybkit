This directory contains a sample analysis of Hyb-format data, published in the quick Crosslinking and Sequencing of Hybrids (qCLASH) experiment described in:
Gay, Lauren A., et al. "Modified cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (qCLASH) identifies Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus microRNA targets in endothelial cells." Journal of virology 92.8 (2018): e02138-17.
 
The sequencing information is available at NCBI Gene Expression Ombnibus (GEO) GSE101978, at:
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE101978

The data files can be downloaded and uncompressed by using the command:
  "sh ./download_data.sh"

The unpacked hyb data-files require ~2 Gb of space.
The completed output of the analysis requires ~N Gb of space.
