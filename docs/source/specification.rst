hybkit Specification
==================================

Version: |spec_version|

    The ".hyb" file format is described by Travis, et al. along with the Hyb software package
    as a "gff-related format that contains sequence identifiers, read sequences, 1-based
    mapping coordinates, and annotation information for each chimera"
    (see :ref:`References`).
    
    Each line in a hyb file, referred to here as a hyb "record," contains information about a 
    genomic sequence read identified to be a chimera by anlaysis sofwtare. 
    Each line contains 15 or 16 columns separated by tab characters ("\\\\t") and provides
    information on each of the alignments identified within the sequence read. 
    The columns are described as follows by Travis, et al.:

        | Column 1, unique sequence identifier.
        | Column 2, read sequence [...].
        | Column 3, predicted binding energy in kcal/mol.
        | Columns 4–9, mapping information for first fragment of read: 
          name of matched transcript, coordinates in 
          read, coordinates in transcript, mapping score.
        | Columns 10–15, mapping information for second fragment of read.
        | Column 16 (optional, [...]), list of annotations in the format: 
          ‘‘feature1=value1; feature2=value2;..." 

    The hybkit project uses an extended version of this description, including assigning
    columns reference names, and defining allowed flags.

Flags
-----
   
    Hyb Flags:
        The following four flags are used by the Hyb software package (see :ref:`References`).
        The definitions provided describe how these flags are used in the hybkit package.
    
        .. _count_total:
        
        :obj:`count_total` - Integer: Total represented hybrid records, if combined.
    
        .. _count_last_clustering:
    
        :obj:`count_last_clustering` - Integer: Total represented hybrid records at last 
        clustering.
                     
        .. _two_way_merged:
        
        :obj:`two_way_merged` - {"0" or "1"} Boolean representation of whether
        entries with mirrored 5' and 3' hybrids were merged if the record is a combined record.
        
        .. _seq_IDs_in_cluster:
    
        :obj:`seq_IDs_in_cluster` -  String: Comma-separated list of all reord IDs of hybrids
        merged into this hybrid entry.

    The following flags are defined by the hybkit package:
        .. _read_count:
    
        :obj:`read_count` -  Integer: Number of sequence reads represented by this record.
        If the record is combined, this represents the total read count for all merged entries.
    
        .. _orient:
    
        :obj:`orient` -  String: Orientation of strand. Options:
        "F" (Forward), "IF" (Inferred Forward),
        "R" (Reverse), "IR" (Inferred Reverse),
        "U" (Unknown), or "IC" (Inferred Conflicting).
    
        .. _seg1_type:
    
        :obj:`seg1_type` - String: Assigned segment type of segment 1, ex: "miRNA" or "mRNA".
    
        .. _seg2_type:
    
        :obj:`seg2_type` - String: Assigned segment type of segment 2, ex: "miRNA" or "mRNA".
    
        .. _seg1_det:
     
        :obj:`seg1_det` -  String: Arbitrary detail about segment 1.
    
        .. _seg2_det:
    
        :obj:`seg2_det` -  String: Arbitrary detail about segment 2.
    
        .. _miRNA_seg:
    
        :obj:`miRNA_seg` -  String: Indicates which (if any) segment mapping is a miRNA
        options are "N" (none), "3p" (seg1), "5p" (seg2),
        "B" (both), or "U" (unknown).
    
        .. _target_reg:
    
        :obj:`target_reg` -  String: Assigned region of the miRNA target.
        options are "5pUTR", "coding", "3pUTR",
        "N" (none), or "U" (unknown).

        :obj:`ext` -  Integer: "0" or "1", Boolean representation of whether
